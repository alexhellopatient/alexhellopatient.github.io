This BAA is the complete and exclusive agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, superseding and replacing all prior agreements, communications, and understandings (written and oral) regarding its subject matter. Any ambiguity in this BAA shall be resolved in favor of the meaning that permits the Parties to comply with applicable law and any current regulations promulgated thereunder.
